## Synopsis

Part of this project was for a college project that I did. Within the project files you'll find a IOS app that is written completely in swift 2.0 and parse. Also a website that uses javascript/bootstrap/sass. 

## Motivation

Wanted to create a college application where a driver could find the location of a user. That driver would then be directed to the GPS within their phone. Also wanted to practice using different design patterns. This went along for designing a funny and overall marketing page for the app

## Installation

Download Xcode and create a parse account 
Upload your parse api to the swift project files 

Website can also be viewed by going to http://jnoren.github.io/Jaunt/JauntWebsite/

## API Reference

Haven't had the chance to update parse since the announcement of it being taken down. Firebase will be where I will move the cloud data to.
